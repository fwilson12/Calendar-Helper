1. Make delete function better 
    - search events without having to specify a day | DONE
    - be able to delete recurring events | DONE


1.5 Ensure Agent Only Reports Successful Actions After Endpoint Confirmation
    - No more error messages but the agent says it deleted/created something
    - ALSO: Adress weird logs.

2. Create event
    - add support for creating recurring events | DONE
    - ask user if event should be recurring after initial prompt message and before tool call | Yeah basically DONE
    - if a time is not specified or if there is a conflict, either 
        - autonomously schedule the event (around the conflict), and tell the user
        - tell the user about the conflict and provide alternatives if conflict, or provide options if time is unspecified


3. Update event feature
    - allow for users to update events
    - shold search for events similar to delete function
    - should support editing recurrence, time changes, etc.

4. Multiple tool calls
    - Should be able to create/delete multiple events from one input.
    - Could also return the schedules for multiple weeks (more than one readEvents call)

5. (After the above)
    - Start working on UI (Basic node.js interface w/ css, don't go too crazy)

6. ???
