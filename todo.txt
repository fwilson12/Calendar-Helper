3. Update event feature |
    - adress time updates leaving duplicates on the calendar 
    - in patch feature (hard coded):
        - after patching an event (whose start & end were mutated):
        - read events for the time slot of the original event
            - with list of events for the time slot of the patched event:
                - feed name: id list into gpt completion
                    - if gpt finds a name matching the name of the event that was patched:
                        - delete that (duplicate) event

                        uhhh dude we already wrote that that's just the delete function lol

                        address the delete call in patch 
                        make sure helper function works


4.75. Helper functions?
    - datetime --> Time (xx:xx), Day, Month, Year 
        - use for msg history/gpt context 
    - match event function -->



5. (After the above)
    - Start working on UI (Basic node.js or react idk , don't go too crazy)
